# BC-Food
The repository for the BC food app.

## Setup

To get it on your computer, open the terminal app on a mac with Xcode 7.0+

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/ # to move to the desktop location, you can move it later
git clone https://github.com/TeamDeverse/BC-Food.git

# enter your github name and password if not already configured
```

Next, we have multiple branches to work off of. In Xcode, be sure to select the proper branch for your subteam.

## Working with the code

Before starting work, we recommend you *copy* your github folder
  *Normally you don't need to do this, but as many of us are new to Git it's a good safety precaution to have a hard copy duplicate*


Be sure when you've finished working on the app to *commit it*, and push to your branch (not master, but your sub team)

**Be sure to remember to select push to remote and select your branch**


# If something goes wrong?
Don't fret. Keep working on your local copy for the time being, and contact your team leader or Patrick to try and get it resolved - but don't let that wait too long, or it will be harder to fix!

In working on your subteams, some files like the storyboard will essentially always have merge conflicts.

Be sure to use the team slack channels for quick help, that's what it's there for!
